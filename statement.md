Here's a simple Python template that you can use as a starting point for your Python projects:

# Import necessary modules here
# For example:
# import math

def main():
    # Write your main code here
    # For example:
    # print("Hello, World!")
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

To use this template, you can replace the comments with your own code. The main() function is where you can write the main logic of your program, and the if __name__ == "__main__": block is where you can call the main() function to execute your program.
